# Comparison with official specifications
## FoV Table
The following table shows a comparison between the values reported by the manufacturer and the ones we obtained. For comparison we also include the rendered values as reported by <a href="https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/"> Richard Musil's database</a>.

As it can be observed, manufacturers' claims are usually not met. The HMD's FoV is smaller than what they report.  

We recommend that in the future, manufacturers provide a more accurate FoV report. Including the average eye relief distance and how the FOV was measured.
