# Comparison with humans' field of view limits

We performed a classical perimetry test to measure the eye's natural visual field limit (Octopus 900, Haag Streit International, Koeniz, Switzerland), and it's equivalent in form of a virtual perimetry. The results show that no HMD fully covers the humans' field of view. The HMD's field of view is smaller than the human's field of view. 

The stimulus (IV2e) had a size of 0.8Â° of visual angle and a luminance of 32 cd m^-2. The background was set at 10 candelas per sqare meter.
